# Meta data file for scene telling it where to load all data from and what to load
# This will be an example file that I will build a parser for later on
# All relative paths will be relative to the final executable that is compiled (like a normal relative path is)
# Need to figure out how to decide what kind of asset the file is (i.e. audio, model, texture, etc.)

[dpath rel] ./assets/

# Textures
<Texture>       # Tells you what asset type we are loading (here it is a texture)
image/container.jpg    'container'          # Load the texture from the given path and then call it container
image/containter2_specular.png  'container_spec'
image/container2.png            'container2'

# Models
<Model>         # Here we want to load models
model/BunkerHill.obj
model/cube.fbx
model/house.fbx

# Audio
<Audio>         # Tells to load audio
sound/Lucas_Scream.wav

# If you want to load an asset from a path that is not the already set default then you can use extern
# ex.
<Model>
