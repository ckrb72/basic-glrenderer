# Sppooikjkky HOrroerr Game
2.5D Game with 3D models for landscape and maybe items/weapons, full rotation on camera

Explain that a town somewhere in the desert middle of nowhere has gone completely radio silent, but satellite images indicate the town is completely disturbed, just suddenly empty. Anybody driving through seems to go missing, and you have been sent in by your agency to investigate. Upon arrival, you get out of your car and enter a home. 

You live in a house next to park/forest, wake up one night and hear a sound and go to them to investigate. You are locked inside the area and pursued by a mysterious forest horror (scary). As you run around the area you can find notes detailing the true story and giving you hints on how to proceed left behind by somebody who had been in your situation. This is all a metaphor lol. It is a metaphor for this woman losing her child during a walk in the woods. The story can either end with the player killing or otherwise beating the monster or the monster devouring her, and it cuts to police talking to her about her dead ass child lmao.
